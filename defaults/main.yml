# defaults file for ansible-gdal-netcdf

# These URL\versions are tooled to reading the NASA NEX climate data
# netCDF files...there was a lot of debugging that went into finding
# a version configuraiton that worked to read those netCDF files
# efficiently across a MackBook and Ubuntu machine. In other words:
# mess with these versions at your own peril.
